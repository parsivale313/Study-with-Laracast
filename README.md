# Study with Laracast

This repository contains my personal learning journey through the **Laravel courses by Jeffrey Way** on [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/).  
Laracasts has been the most valuable and enjoyable resource I've found for mastering Laravel, and I wanted to document this experience as a part of my learning path.
